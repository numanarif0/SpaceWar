## About

**SpaceWar** is a C#-built game inspired by the classic genre—a space combat experience featuring spaceship battles under the pull of a central star. The player's challenge lies in mastering limited fuel and ammunition while avoiding gravitational capture. Developed as an educational and hobbyist project, this repository is a showcase of game logic, physics mechanics, and C# implementation.

## Features
- Two-player space combat  
- Dynamic gravitational field centered around a star  
- Fuel and projectile (e.g., torpedoes) management  
- Hyperdrive-powered random teleportation  
- Victory determined by surviving collisions (with the star, projectiles, or opponent)
